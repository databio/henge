# Henge 

Henge is a Python package that builds backends for generic decomposable recursive unique identifiers (or, *DRUIDs*). It is intended to be used as a building block for refget 2.0 on collections (see [`refget-py`](https://github.com/databio/refget-py) package), and also for other data types that need content-derived identifiers.
