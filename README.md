# Henge 

Henge is a Python package that builds backends for generic decomposable recursive unique identifiers (or, *DRUIDs*). It is intended to be used as a building block for sequence collections (see the [seqcol package](https://github.com/databio/seqcol)), and also for other data types that need content-derived identifiers.
